"""A crash-safe write-ahead log (WAL).

Durability for a database means: once an operation is acknowledged, it survives a
crash. The standard mechanism is a write-ahead log — every mutation is appended
to an on-disk log and flushed *before* it is acknowledged, so recovery can replay
the log onto the last snapshot.

Two correctness properties this implementation guarantees:

* **Durability on commit** — :meth:`append` (and :meth:`append_batch`) flush the
  Python buffer and ``os.fsync`` the file descriptor before returning, so an
  acknowledged record is on stable storage.
* **Torn-write tolerance** — each record is framed as a 4-byte big-endian length
  followed by that many bytes of pickled payload, terminated by a 4-byte CRC32 of
  the payload. On replay, a final record whose length runs past EOF, or whose CRC
  does not match (a half-written tail from a crash mid-append), is discarded — the
  log recovers to the last *fully durable* record rather than raising.

Pickle is used (not JSON) because Knowledge Objects carry numpy arrays; the WAL
is a local, trusted file, never a deserialisation surface for external input.
